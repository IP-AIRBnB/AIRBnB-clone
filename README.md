# Airbnb Clone

This is a simple Airbnb clone created using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. The project aims to replicate the core visual and functional elements of the Airbnb website, providing users with a clean and responsive interface.

## Features

- **Homepage**: Displays a clean and visually appealing layout with a navigation bar, hero section, and featured properties.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for properties using filters like location, check-in/check-out dates, and number of guests.
- **Property Listing Page**: Displays a list of available properties with details like name, price, and ratings.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and works across different screen sizes.
- **Static Data**: All property and user data is hardcoded into the project.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, including Flexbox and Grid for responsive design.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For adding interactivity, such as filtering properties and toggling UI elements.
